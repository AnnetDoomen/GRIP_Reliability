# GRIP_Human_Activity_Patterns

The GRIP (beweeGsensoren voor mensen met chRonIsche Pijn) project, aims to use movement sensors (accelerometers) in order to model the complex activity patterns of people with Chronic Pain (CP).
Several challenges arise in this project, for example lack of enough labeled data that allows for a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to properly learn about the activity patterns of people with CP.

The Data Science Pool (DSP) team collaborates with researchers from the [Lifestyle and Health](https://www.internationalhu.com/research/lifestyle-and-health) Department at the University of Applied Sciences in this effort.

In this repo we keep a centralized Sandbox, where we experiment with open source datasets in order to gather further understanding about the technicalities of working with sensor data, in our case accelerometers.

Many parts of the code are simple jupyter notebooks where we perform the experiments; we use openly available datasets and code for our tests.

## Overview

The project is designed to take raw accelerometer data, preprocess it, classify it into physical activity categories, and then calculate various physical activity features. The workflow includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Raw data cleaning and synchronization.
- **Activity Classification**: Classification into different physical intesitities: sedentairy, light, medium and high intensity.
- **Feature Calculation**: Daily features based on the classification bouts.

## Usage

Create data folder and add subfolders

- Set the sample frequency and sample size in the config file.
- Add data to the raw_data folder

Create virtual env

- python -m venv venv
- pip install -r requirements.txt

run files

- Check settings in main.py
- Run main.py

## Features

- **Sensor Data Processing**: Process raw accelerometer data to extract movement patterns.
- **Activity Classification**: Classify physical activities into predefined categories using machine learning or rule-based models.
- **Daily Activity Features**: Calculate total time in each physical activity category and complexity of movement patterns during the day.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: Easy to modify or add additional feature extraction or classification methods.

## Data Requirements

- **Input**: The input should be raw accelerometer data in the following format:

  - **Sensor settings**: Settings in the first 8 lines
  - **Timestamp**:
  - **X, Y, Z acceleration**: Raw acceleration data in 3 axes.
  - **Timestamp True time**: Timestamp true time in miliseconds (before and after sensor data)
